The following tutorial explains how to set up Foreman authentication against FreeIPA (or Identity Management) server. We will use an external FreeIPA server and enable single sign-on based on Kerberos-tickets using **mod_auth_kerb**, access control with **mod_authnz_pam**, PAM (pluggable authentication module) authentication via **mod_intercept_form_submit**, and automatic population of Foreman users and their attributes and groups with the help of **mod_lookup_identity** and **sssd-dbus**.
