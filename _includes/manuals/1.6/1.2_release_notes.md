## Release notes for {{page.version}}

### Headline features

#### Config groups for Puppet class associations

A new "config group" entity has been added to enable groups of Puppet classes to be created for easy association with new hosts and host groups.  The new config group lets a list of Puppet classes be contained into a single list, independently of environments and parameter information.

When creating a new host or host group, the Puppet class tab allows association of individual classes as before, or config groups to link many classes to the host or host group in one action.

#### Realm and FreeIPA join integration

Using a new proxy API and FreeIPA-based implementation, Foreman is now able to manage the lifecycle of hosts joined to a FreeIPA realm or domain from initial provisioning to deletion.  In the same way that DNS or DHCP orchestration is handled, Foreman can now be configured with a list of realms (e.g. EXAMPLE.COM) through the web UI or API which can be associated with a host on creation.

As Foreman creates the new host, it calls to the smart proxy to create a host object in FreeIPA which returns a one-time password for enrollment.  This password is stored in Foreman and supplied to the host inside the provisioning template, so the host is automatically joined after installation (kickstart templates have been updated).  In addition to creating a host object, Foreman sends the host group name which allows FreeIPA to make use of it for its own group automember rules.  When a host is rebuilt, the existing host in FreeIPA is disabled (so keytabs are invalidated) and the OTP is regenerated.  Similarly when a host is deleted, the host in FreeIPA is deleted too.

More information about the necessary smart proxy configuration is available in the [FreeIPA realm configuration](/manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.3.11FreeIPARealm) section.  [#4917](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/4917) tracks Active Directory support in a future version of Foreman.

#### Fine-grained authorization roles and improvements

In Foreman 1.5, the authorization system that controls users' access to resources has had a massive overhaul, making it much more flexible and powerful.  In previous versions, the authorization system was linked to users with a number of filters to permit or restrict access to hosts by ownership, domain, compute resource, host group and facts. Permissions were granted to a role and the role assigned to a user - so a user with an "edit_hosts" permission on a role would be able to edit all hosts that they were able to see, as defined by the filters (if any).

The first key change is that these user filters are now part of the role and have been changed to use the standard search syntax used throughout the Foreman UI and API. When creating a role to edit hosts, the permissions can now be associated with a filter, so a user is only able to edit hosts that match the defined filter (e.g. where the name is "foo.example.com", the host group is "My sub-organization" or a parameter has a certain value). Multiple filters can be added with different permissions, allowing a more nuanced set of permissions to be assigned via a single role.

The second key change is an improvement in user group support. User groups were only useful for defining group ownership of hosts in previous versions, but now they can be assigned roles which are inherited by all of the group's members (including other nested groups). The admin flag, which previously could only be set on a user and gives complete, unrestricted access to Foreman, can now be set on a user group too.

More information about setting up filters and roles is available in the [Roles and Permissions](/manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.1.2RolesandPermissions) section.

#### Image provisioning support on oVirt, libvirt and VMware

oVirt, libvirt and VMware compute resource providers are all now able to provision new hosts with images followed by a finish script run over SSH, in the same manner as the EC2 provider.  The type of provisioning method can be selected under the "Operating system" tab when creating a new host.

For oVirt, RHEV and VMware, images in Foreman are linked to a template stored on the virtualization server.  For libvirt, images are implemented with qcow2 backing disks so new hosts are created with the image disk and use copy-on-write (COW) for the new host.  Images are configured in Foreman by navigating to the compute resource and clicking *New Image*, linking it to an operating system and filling in some details.

In all three cases, the template needs to have a username and password set up for Foreman to SSH in after provisioning and run the finish script and require some form of DHCP orchestration for SSH access to the newly created host to work.  A finish template to perform any post-build actions (e.g. setting up Puppet) must also be associated to the host, usually by changing the OS default finish template.

More information about the requirements for image support on all three compute resource providers is available in the [Compute Resources](/manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#5.2ComputeResources) section.

#### Installer support for plugins and compute resources

The Foreman installer is now able to install plugins and compute resource packages along with Foreman itself, making it easier for users to get started with common and useful plugins.  To see the plugins and compute resources that can be enabled, read the [Installer Options section](/manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.2.2InstallerOptions) or the examples below:

* `foreman-installer --enable-foreman-compute-ec2` installs foreman-compute for EC2 compute resource support
* `foreman-installer --enable-foreman-plugin-discovery` installs the [foreman_discovery plugin](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_discovery) for MaaS support
* `foreman-installer --enable-foreman-plugin-templates` installs the [foreman_templates plugin](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_templates) for template synchronization

The following plugins are now installed by default:

* [foreman_setup](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_setup) to help set up provisioning support with DHCP and DNS
* [foreman_bootdisk](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_bootdisk) to provide ISO and USB disks for provisioning
