So far we have tried external authentication for existing Foreman users.

However, it is also possible to have the user's records in Foreman created automatically, on the fly when they first log in using external authentication (single sign-on, PAM).

The first step to enable this feature is to add

:authorize_login_delegation_auth_source_user_autocreate: External

to `/etc/foreman/settings.yaml` or under *Administer > Settings > Auth*.

Since we will want the newly created user records to have valid name and email address, we need to set up **sssd** to provide these attributes and **mod_lookup_identity** to pass them to Foreman. We start by installing the packages:
{% highlight bash %}
yum install -y sssd-dbus mod_lookup_identity
{% endhighlight %}

Amend the configuration of sssd in `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf`:

{% highlight text %}
# /etc/sssd/sssd.conf, the [domain/...] section, add:
ldap_user_extra_attrs = email:mail, firstname:givenname, lastname:sn

# /etc/sssd/sssd.conf, the [sssd] section, amend the services line to include ifp:
services = nss, pam, ssh, ifp

# /etc/sssd/sssd.conf, add new [ifp] section:
[ifp]
allowed_uids = apache, root
user_attributes = +email, +firstname, +lastname
{% endhighlight %}

Configure Apache to retrieve these attributes, for example in `/etc/httpd/conf.d/lookup_identity.conf`:
{% highlight text %}
LoadModule lookup_identity_module modules/mod_lookup_identity.so
<LocationMatch ^/users/(ext)?login$>
  LookupUserAttr email REMOTE_USER_EMAIL " "
  LookupUserAttr firstname REMOTE_USER_FIRSTNAME
  LookupUserAttr lastname REMOTE_USER_LASTNAME
</LocationMatch>
{% endhighlight %}

Restart both sssd and Apache:
{% highlight bash %}
service sssd restart
service httpd restart
{% endhighlight %}

Now when you log in either using Kerberos ticket or using user's FreeIPA password (make sure the user has access allowed in FreeIPA HBAC rule), even if the user did not log in to Foreman before, their record will be populated with name and email address from the FreeIPA server (you can check in the top right corner that the full name is there).
