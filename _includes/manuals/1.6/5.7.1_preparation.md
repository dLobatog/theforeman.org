We assume the Foreman machine is FreeIPA-enrolled:
{% highlight bash %}
ipa-client-install
{% endhighlight %}

On the FreeIPA server, we create the service:
{% highlight bash %}
ipa service-add HTTP/<the-foreman-hostname>
{% endhighlight %}

We also create HBAC (host-based access control) service and rule on the FreeIPA server and define matching PAM service on the Foreman machine. In the following examples, we will use service name *foreman-prod*.

On the FreeIPA server, we define the HBAC service and rule and link them together:
{% highlight bash %}
ipa hbacsvc-add foreman-prod
ipa hbacrule-add allow_foreman_prod
ipa hbacrule-add-service allow_foreman_prod --hbacsvcs=foreman-prod
{% endhighlight %}

Then we add user we wish to have access to the service foreman-prod, and the hostname of our Foreman server:
{% highlight bash %}
ipa hbacrule-add-user allow_foreman_prod --user=<username>
ipa hbacrule-add-host allow_foreman_prod --hosts=<the-foreman-hostname>
{% endhighlight %}
Alternatively, host groups and user groups could be added to the *allow_foreman_prod* rule.

At any point of the configuration, we can check the status of the rule:
{% highlight bash %}
ipa hbacrule-find foreman-prod
ipa hbactest --user=<username> --host=<the-foreman-hostname> --service=foreman-prod
{% endhighlight %}

Chances are there will be HBAC rule *allow_all* matching besides our new *allow_foreman_prod* rule. See <http://www.freeipa.org/page/Howto/HBAC_and_allow_all> for steps to disable the catchall *allow_all* HBAC rule while maintaining the correct operation of your FreeIPA server and enrolled clients. The goal is only *allow_foreman_prod* matching when checked with `ipa hbactest`.

Next step is to define PAM service on the Foreman machine. We create file `/etc/pam.d/foreman-prod` with the following content:
{% highlight text %}
auth    required   pam_sss.so
account required   pam_sss.so
{% endhighlight %}

We will also want to enable two SELinux booleans on the Foreman machine:
{% highlight bash %}
setsebool -P allow_httpd_mod_auth_pam on
setsebool -P httpd_dbus_sssd on
{% endhighlight %}

Until all the packages are part of your operation system distribution, you can get them from Jan Pazdziora's copr yum repo. At <http://copr-fe.cloud.fedoraproject.org/coprs/adelton/identity_demo/> choose the correct `.repo` file. For example, for Foreman on RHEL 6, the following command will configure yum:
{% highlight bash %}
wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/adelton-identity_demo.repo \
  http://copr-fe.cloud.fedoraproject.org/coprs/adelton/identity_demo/repo/epel-6-i386/
{% endhighlight %}

The `yum install` operations in the next sections will use this newly configured repo.
